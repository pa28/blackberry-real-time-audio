The ZIP file contains a MS Windows installer that will install compiled versions for BlackBerry OS versions
4.2.1, 4.3, 4.5 and 4.61; an ALX file for the Desktop Manager; and documentation in PDF format. This binary
was initially released un the Eclipse Public License version 1.0. New binaries will be released under
GNU GPL v 3 or later.

On Windows 7 (and probably Vista) you will have to run the installer (and the uninstaller if you choose to)
as the Administrator. Extract the installer from the ZIP, then righ click on the installer and select
'Run as Administrator'.
